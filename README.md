📊 Google Play Store Data Analysis

📌 Project Description
This project analyzes data from the Google Play Store to gain insights into app ratings, reviews, pricing, and categories. Using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, we explore trends and correlations between different app attributes.

📌 Dataset
Source: Google Play Store dataset from Kaggle

Size: (10841*13)

Attributes:
App Name 
Category
Reviews
Rating
Price
Installs
Type (Free/Paid)

📌 Technologies Used
🔹 Python
🔹 Pandas & NumPy
🔹 Matplotlib & Seaborn
🔹 Jupyter Notebook

📌 Key Findings from Analysis
1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
✔ Removed duplicate and missing values to ensure data accuracy.
✔ Converted Installs, Reviews, and Price to numeric format for proper analysis.

2️⃣ App Ratings & Reviews
✔ Average Rating: Apps have an average rating of 4.2, with most rated between 4.0 - 4.5.
✔ Apps with higher reviews (50K+ reviews) generally have more stable ratings.
✔ New apps (<1K reviews) show greater rating fluctuations, making them harder to assess.

3️⃣ Installs & Popularity Trends
✔ Apps with 10M+ installs tend to have ratings above 4.2, indicating user trust.
✔ Education, Productivity, and Health & Fitness apps receive higher ratings.
✔ Gaming apps dominate in downloads but have a wider range of ratings due to competition.

4️⃣ Free vs. Paid Apps
✔ 90%+ of apps are free, and they receive higher downloads than paid apps.
✔ Paid apps ($5+) have lower installs but higher satisfaction among users.
✔ Freemium model is the most successful—users prefer free apps with optional premium features.

5️⃣ Effect of App Size on Installs
✔ Small apps (<50MB) are more popular, getting higher downloads.
✔ Heavy apps (>100MB), especially in gaming, need better optimization to retain users.

6️⃣ Category-Wise Competition
✔ Most Competitive: Games, Business, and Tools categories have too many apps.
✔ Less Competitive & High Potential: Medical and Finance apps have fewer apps but higher trust requirements.

7️⃣ Impact of Updates on Ratings
✔ Apps that update every 2-4 months maintain higher ratings (4.2+ on average).
✔ Frequent updates improve app retention and user satisfaction.

:📌 Conclusion 
🔹 Top-rated categories: Education, Productivity, and Health & Fitness apps have the highest ratings.
🔹 Installs & Ratings: Popular apps (10M+ installs) maintain high ratings, while new apps show fluctuations.
🔹 Free vs. Paid Apps: Free apps dominate in downloads, but paid apps have higher satisfaction.
🔹 App Size Matters: Smaller apps (<50MB) gain more installs, while larger apps need optimization.
🔹 Frequent Updates Help: Regular updates (every 2-4 months) improve app ratings and user engagement.
🔹 Freemium Model Wins: Free apps with premium features are the most effective for monetization.
